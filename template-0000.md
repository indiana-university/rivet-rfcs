## Summary
> Short explanation of the feature.

## Motivation
> Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

## Detailed design
> This is the bulk of the RFC.

> Explain the design in enough detail for anyone familiar with Rivet to understand, and for anyone who wants to try to implement the design to do so. This part should be specific and include examples of how the feature will be used. Any new terminology should be defined here.

## How we teach this
> What names and terminology work best for these concepts and why? How is this idea best presented? Where does it make sense to follow existing Rivet conventions? Where should we create new conventions?

> How should this feature be introduced and documented for existing Rivet users?

## Drawbacks
> Why should we *not* do this? Consider the impact on existing Rivet users vs. the benefit of this new feature.

> There are tradeoffs to choosing any path, please attempt to identify them here.

## Alternatives
> What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?

> Are the other existing solutions we cold leverage?

## Unresolved questions
> Optional, but suggested for first drafts. What parts of the design are still TBD?
